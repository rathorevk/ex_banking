defmodule ExBanking.RateLimiter do
  @moduledoc """
  This module implements a rate-limiting mechanism using the sliding window technique.

  The sliding window technique allows you to restrict the number of events or requests
  that can occur within a specified time window, helping to prevent abuse,
  manage system load, and ensure fair usage.

  ## Config
  ```

    # Size of the rate limiting window in milliseconds.

    # The maximum number of requests allowed for the window.
    maximum_request_count: 10,
    # Interval in the milliseconds for removing outdated data from the usage table.
    cleanup_interval_ms: 120 * 1000
